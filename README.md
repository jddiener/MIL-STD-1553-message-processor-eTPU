# MIL-STD-1553-message-processor-eTPU
This project is a software-based MIL-STD-1553 MT/RT/BC message processor for NXP microcontrollers with an eTPU. It leverages the eTPU, a timing co-processor found on many NXP MPC5xxx microcontroller parts, to minimize the amount of external hardware necessary to implement a 1553 interface, and minimze the amount of host CPU processing required to manage the interface.  The drivers implement all terminal types - monitor terminal (MT), remote terminal (RT), and bus controller (BC). For detailed information, please review the documentation that is included with the project.
